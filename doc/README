Submarine is a Common Lisp library that's somewhere between a
PostgreSQL library an an object persistency system.  It uses
Postmodern to communicate with the database. The basic idea is that
you create your classes in the metaclass DB-CLASS and submarine cares
about creating SQL tables or, if the tables already exist, checking if
they conform to the provided specification.  Moreover, Submarine
supports an intuitive way of expressing both one-to-many and
many-to-many relations.

You can get more information about the project from its website,
